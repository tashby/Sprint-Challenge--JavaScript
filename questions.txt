Describe the biggest difference between .forEach & .map.
    forEach doesn't return anything. It just calls a function on each array element.
    Map will also call a function on each element, but then return the result values into a new array.

What is the difference between a function and a method?
    A method is a function that is associated with an object. Essentially they are the same.

    What is closure? A closure is a reference to an object in the outer scope. A closure is created
    everytime a function is created.

    Describe the four rules of the 'this' keyword.
    When called in the global scope; this refers to the entire current window/environment.
    When this is called after an objects name and dot; it is referring to that object.
    When a constructor is used; This refers to what is returned.
    When call or apply method is used; this needs to be defined.

    Why do we need super() in an extended class? It is used to access and call functions of that objects parents. It must be used before the this keyword.
